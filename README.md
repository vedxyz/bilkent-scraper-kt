# bilkent-scraper-kt

Makeshift JVM-based API for Bilkent University services, achieved through lots of scraping.

Somewhat feature complete, somewhat work in progress.

This project was initially implemented with TypeScript, in another repository.
Both ecosystems have their own merits, and I'm not sure which project will
stay alive going forward (possibly both?).

## Disclaimer

This is not an official project backed by the Bilkent University.
It harmlessly scrapes the endpoints made available by them to any user.
Do not misuse this package.

I do **not** (cannot) guarantee that the package will work as intended.
Changes to the endpoints made by the university **may break functionality at any time**.
